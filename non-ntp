# This script set's the server minute and second time stamp to that of NTP exactly, but retaining the server's hour time stamp.
# It is an aboslute requirement for NTP to be disabled within the server OS
# This can be useful for when the server is set to gmt time zone but requires that of a time of a country other than gmt (i.e: greece)

# Add to server root cron:
# i.e: */1 * * * * /u/espbin/non-ntp > /dev/null 2>&1

# Get the server's hour time stamp and output to file
date +%H > /tmp/serverhour

# Get the time from the web (which will be GMT) and ouput to file
date -d "$(curl -s --head http://google.com | grep ^Date: | sed 's/Date: //g')" > /tmp/webfulltime

# Extract the web's GMT minute time stamp and output to file
cat /tmp/webfulltime | cut -d " " -f5 | cut -d ":" -f2 > /tmp/webminute

# Extract the web's GMT hour time stamp and output to file
# cat /tmp/webfulltime | cut -d " " -f5 | cut -d ":" -f1 > /tmp/webhour

# Extract the web's GMT second time stamp and output to file
cat /tmp/webfulltime | cut -d " " -f5 | cut -d ":" -f3 > /tmp/websecond

# Set the time using the server's hour time stamp and the web's minute & second time stamp
date -s $(cat /tmp/serverhour):$(cat /tmp/webminute):$(cat /tmp/websecond)
